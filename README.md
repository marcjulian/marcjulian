## Hey, I am Marc 🤙

I'm a full stack software developer from Germany developing Apps for the Web and Mobile. I love [open source](https://github.com/marcjulian) and I [share](https://notiz.dev) my experiences about my favorite tech stack.

I even got the chance hosting video workshops about NestJS and Prisma:

- [Building a REST API with NestJS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmbd5hcQUaY) - [Workshop](https://www.notion.so/marcjulian/Building-a-REST-API-with-NestJS-and-Prisma-8296846a0fc54ac0b445ae9364805669) at Prisma Day 2021
- [Accessing Databases using NestJS with Prisma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlVJ340UEuk) - Showcase at Prisma Day 2020
